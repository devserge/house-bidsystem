# Bidding system for houses

For a school assignment I needed to create a application that is meant to sell houses. But.. not just one house. I needed to create a system that is able to being deployed anywhere. So, I started to develop it. And here it is. It isn't the most great code I ever made. I used mysqli and the images on the side aren't editable. So, don't blame me for making the school assignment in a hurry. But, I can do more. 

# How do I use this?
Let me say first; it is not used to be deployed for production. Just to take a look at something I coded. When downloading this, just upload the files and go to the website you placed it on. Then follow the setup steps, and you are done.

# Get in contact
Of course you can get in contact with me to make a application or something. You can hit me up on discord echo("DevSerge");#8876 or send me a mail at serge@spixo.nl
